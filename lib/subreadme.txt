# this directory is for the libs of lapack, but they are all compiled in my own computer and still with a test error of complex*16 
# -calculation, so if it doesn't work in your computer when you try to conpile this procedure (you may get 'lapack error' message).

# you'd better download and compile the lapack-package by yourself in your computer.
# LAPACK (the site http://netlib.sandia.gov/lapack/)
# and then put the liblapack.a libreblas.a libtmglib.a in this directory, finally try to compile this pricedure again.
